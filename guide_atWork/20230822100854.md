## Integrating with External Applications

### Synchronization with Desktop Mode
The desktop variant of SimGraphVisualizer is proficient at interfacing with external applications. Transmitting the state of an in-process graph to auxiliary apps can yield transformative graph states, which are then seamlessly displayed in SimGraphVisualizer. Tailoring which external applications to interface with is facilitated through a dedicated settings window.

### Settings Window

**Availability**: Currently exclusive to the desktop version.

**Functionality**: Central to defining parameters for external app synchronization.

**Settings Storage**: User configurations are stored as a JSON text file for simplicity and ease of access.

### Conclusion
To fully leverage SimGraphVisualizer, integrate both its innate functionalities and its ability to synchronize with external applications. This harmonized approach, coupled with intuitive configurations, ensures an enriched user experience.


Ah, yes! The term you're referencing is the "Ising model", not "Isign". The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes magnetic materials. Here's a brief overview:

## What the hell is Ising Model?

The Ising model is named after Ernst Ising, who studied it as a doctoral student in the 1920s. It's one of the simplest models to describe ferromagnetism, but it has found applications in a variety of fields, from neural networks to optimization problems.

The model consists of a lattice (often a regular grid, but can be more general) where each site on the lattice has a spin that can be either up (+1) or down (-1). The energy of a configuration of spins is typically given by:

\[ E = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - h \sum_i s_i \]

Where:
- \( \langle i,j \rangle \) denotes pairs of neighboring sites.
- \( s_i \) and \( s_j \) are the spins at sites i and j.
- \( J \) is the interaction strength between spins. If \( J > 0 \), it's a ferromagnetic interaction (spins prefer to align). If \( J < 0 \), it's an antiferromagnetic interaction (spins prefer to be opposite).
- \( h \) is an external magnetic field.

The challenge in the Ising model is often to find the ground state, i.e., the configuration of spins with the lowest energy, especially for certain complex or large lattices.

### Quantum Computing and Ising Model

The Ising model and its quantum counterpart, the quantum Ising model, have gained significant attention in the realm of quantum computing. This is because many optimization problems can be mapped onto an Ising model, and quantum annealers, like those developed by D-Wave, are designed to find the minimum energy configuration of such models, thus solving the associated optimization problem.

In the context of "Ising graphs", the graph represents the lattice structure of the Ising model. Nodes represent lattice sites, and edges indicate interactions between spins.
